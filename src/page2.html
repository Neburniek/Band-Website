                        <p>Auron Miller has been learning to play guitar since he was 12. His grandfather strongly
                            believed
                            that the music was the only thing could make people happy and teached him how to play until
                            his very last moment. Auron's grandfather passed away in 1999 at the age of 65.</p>

                            so

                            with this instrument. He is currently the best bassist you can find in Liverpool.</p>
